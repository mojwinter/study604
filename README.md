# study604.ca
## Inspiration
As students living off-campus, studying and working from home every day can become a drag. It's nice to change up the scenery once in a while. That's why we created **study604**.
## What it does
Our app helps students and remote workers quickly find the best study-friendly spots in their city. Instead of wasting time searching or guessing, users can explore caf√©s, libraries, and co-working spaces rated by users for Wi-Fi reliability, noise levels, space, refreshments, and outlet access. 
## How we built it
**study604** is a mobile web app built using React and TypeScript, and employing Supabase for the backend solution. We leveraged the Google Maps API to get update-to-date location information and an interactive map. 
## Challenges we ran into
Fully developing the nitty gritty details of our application and, it being our first time using Figma, creating a clean, user-friendly interface.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
That we built something genuinely useful for students like ourselves and that we managed to get it together in time. 
## What we learned
Mobile-first development, Google Maps API integration, and much, much more.
## What's next for study604
